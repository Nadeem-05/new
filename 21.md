Certainly, here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a Django web application that involves handling HTTP requests and responses, defining views and templates, working with forms, and using Django's default Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):

**Step 1: Set Up a Django Project**

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate"
   ```

3. Install Django:

   ```bash
   pip install Django
   ```

4. Create a new Django project:

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject mywebapp
   cd mywebapp
   ```

**Step 2: Create a Django App**

Create a new app within your project. An app is a self-contained module for a specific functionality within your project:

```bash
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

**Step 3: Define Models**

In the `models.py` file of your app (`myapp` in this case), define the data models. For this example, we'll create a simple model for a blog post:

```python
# myapp/models.py
from django.db import models

class BlogPost(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

**Step 4: Create and Apply Migrations**

Run the following commands to create and apply migrations for your models:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

**Step 5: Create Views**

Define views that handle HTTP requests and responses. In your app's `views.py` file (`myapp/views.py`), create a view function for displaying a list of blog posts:

```python
# myapp/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import BlogPost

def blog_post_list(request):
    posts = BlogPost.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'myapp/blog_post_list.html', {'posts': posts})
```

**Step 6: Create URL Patterns**

Define URL patterns to link views to specific URLs. In the `urls.py` file of your app (`myapp/urls.py`), create a URL pattern for the `blog_post_list` view:

```python
# myapp/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('posts/', views.blog_post_list, name='blog_post_list'),
]
```

**Step 7: Create Templates**

Create HTML templates in the `templates` directory of your app to display data. In this case, create a template for displaying a list of blog posts:

```html
{# myapp/templates/myapp/blog_post_list.html #}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Blog Posts</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for post in posts %}
            <li>{{ post.title }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

**Step 8: Update Project URL Patterns**

Include the app's URLs in the project's `urls.py` file (`mywebapp/urls.py`):

```python
# mywebapp/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),
]
```

**Step 9: Run the Development Server**

Start the development server to run your Django web application:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now access your Django web application, interact with the default database using Django's ORM, and view a list of blog posts.

This is a simplified example to get you started. For a more complex application, you can expand on this foundation and add features like user authentication, form handling, and more advanced views.
