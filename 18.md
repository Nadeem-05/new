To build a Flask form for collecting user input in a contact form (name, email, message) and create a route to handle form submissions, you can follow these steps:

**Step 1: Create a Flask Application**

Create a Flask application and set up the basic structure. You should have a project directory with a Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and a folder for templates (`templates`) to store your HTML templates.

**Step 2: Create the HTML Form**

Create an HTML form that will be used to collect user input. Save this form in a new HTML file within the `templates` folder. Let's call this file `contact_form.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Contact Form</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Contact Us</h1>
    <form method="POST" action="/submit">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" required><br>

        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="email" name="email" required><br>

        <label for="message">Message:</label>
        <textarea name="message" required></textarea><br>

        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

**Step 3: Create the Flask Routes**

Define two routes in your Flask application:

- A route to display the contact form.
- A route to handle form submissions and display a "Thank you" message upon successful submission.

Here's the Python code for `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name)

@app.route("/")
def show_contact_form():
    return render_template("contact_form.html")

@app.route("/submit", methods=["POST"])
def submit_form():
    if request.method == "POST":
        name = request.form["name"]
        email = request.form["email"]
        message = request.form["message"]

        # Here, you can process the form data, e.g., store it in a database, send an email, etc.

        return "<h1>Thank you for your submission!</h1>"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Step 4: Run the Flask Application**

Run your Flask application using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser to access the contact form. Users can fill in their name, email, and message, and upon submission, they will see a "Thank you" message.

Please note that in a real application, you should validate user input, handle form data securely, and potentially use a database to store submissions or send emails. Additionally, you can enhance the form's styling and error handling based on your requirements.
